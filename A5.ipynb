The presence of a seven-day cycle in the weather is \"eerie\" evidence that human activity influences the weather.\n\nYour mission in this assignment is to see if you can validate their claim using data from the instruments at RDU airport. Of course, the NASA researchers had access to much richer data, so we are not really equipped to confirm or refute their claim but we're in the southeast, and have some data, let's see what we can do.\n\nI have collected 10 years of data into a single file, `A5/krdu-rain-2001-2010.csv`, in a format suitable for use with np.loadtxt(). The data have 4 columns; year, month, day, and rainfall in inches.\n\nFirst, you should read these posts by Allen Downey:\n\n1. <a href=\"http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/05/there-is-only-one-test.html\">There is only one test!</a>\n2. <a href=\"http://allendowney.blogspot.com/2011/06/more-hypotheses-less-trivia.html\">More hypotheses, less trivia.</a> Pay special attention to the paragraph <b>Permutation</b> under <b>Difference in means</b>. You shouldn't use his code; write your own.\n\n##What to do\n\n1. Read the data.\n2. Determine the days of the week from the dates. (You can't just slice the array)\n3. Write a function to get the average daily rainfall during midweek (Tuesday through Thursday) and weekend (Saturday through Monday).\n4. Report the average rainfall for midweek and weekend, and their difference (delta). I provide a check for this so you can be sure you're on the right track.\n5. Determine and report the p value (the likelyhood that the effect is not real) by simulation. You'll need to first, compute the delta which in our case is the difference between the means for midweek and weekend. Then you'll run the function many times, each time permuting the day labels, and counting the number of times that the difference between the new means is greater than delta. Now divide that count by the number of trials you ran. That will be the p value. If count is 0, that means you didn't find even a single permutation that produced a greater difference in means; the effect is very likely real. On the other hand, if count is huge, then there were many permutations that produced greater differences, so the difference is likely just random.\n"
